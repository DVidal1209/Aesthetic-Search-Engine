# Project 1: Aesthetic Search Engine
## Find your aesthetic with inspirational gifs and images.

When you enter [our application](https://dvidal1209.github.io/project-1/), you'll see a header with different inspiration photos for fashion, 
interior design, art, and so on. 

Below that is a box with a search bar and dropdown menu. Enter a keyword for your aesthetic, select a type of media
from the dropdown menu, and press the search button! Once you hit search, results in the form of images and gifs will
populate the screen below the search box. As you scroll, the footer containing our contact information, a "Return to
Top" button, and a search history button will follow you down the page for easy access. 

If you'd like to view your recent searches, click the "History" button and a tab listing them will open. To clear your 
search history, simply click the "CLear History" button. Alternatively, you can revisit previous searches by clicking
on them from the History tab. 

We used HTML, CSS, Bulma (for the search box positioning), and JavaScript for the functionality. We also used the
Imgur and Giphy APIs to pull our search results from.
